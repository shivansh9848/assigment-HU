## Key Findings Summary
For a secure todo app with login and projects, use HTTPS, validate inputs, and manage user authentication securely. Follow secure coding best practices and regularly update dependencies.

Risks include data security, scalability issues, and potential dependency on third-party services. Constraints involve limited customization and user experience challenges. Edge cases may involve task prioritization and sorting of user-created tasks.

## How Research Impacts Decisions
This research is persisted as a first-class artifact and is intended to inform downstream epic/story/spec decisions. Examples: confirming best-practice security guidance, identifying common feature expectations, and surfacing risks/constraints. When generating epics/stories, we will cite these URLs and justify choices (the 'why X was chosen' requirement).

          "content": "# 9 Best Practices for Secure Coding in 2026. ## What Are Secure Coding Practices? Secure coding refers to the consistent practices developers use throughout the software development lifecycle to protect sensitive data and reduce critical vulnerabilities. By validating inputs, handling malicious data safely, and carefully managing third-party code, secure coding ensures that every part of an application strengthens the organization’s overall security posture. Following established secure coding guidelines helps align development with industry compliance standards and reduce vulnerability risks. ### How Do Secure Coding Practices Reduce Security Vulnerabilities in the Software Development Life Cycle? Among all secure coding techniques, input validation stands as the cornerstone of a robust secure software development process. ### How Does the Secure Coding Practices Checklist Guide the Development Process? Security Journey’s role-based training mirrors this layering, helping developers move from foundational lessons (like input validation) to advanced topics (like cloud secrets rotation and API hardening). ## What Best Practices Do You Follow for Secure Code Review?"

The development of mobile applications comes with its own set of challenges, especially in a competitive market, from navigating technical complexities to meeting user expectations. Common challenges in app development projects include scope creep, unclear requirements, tight deadlines, and budget constraints. Test each potential feature against your app's main purpose and target user persona. Remove features that don't clearly solve your users' challenges. Whether it’s tackling moving goalposts, avoiding feature bloat, or ensuring you’re building something people truly want, the key lies in proactive planning, clear communication, and a relentless focus on user value. By addressing challenges like cross-platform compatibility, performance optimization, and security concerns with strategic solutions, you set the stage for an app that’s not only functional but also future-ready. And when you integrate flexibility, user-centric design, and continuous learning into your development approach, you create a foundation that can adapt to change, deliver impact, and thrive in a competitive landscape."

Broken access control remains the leading risk in web application security. OWASP recommends logging security-relevant events such as authentication attempts and access failures, protecting logs from tampering, centralizing monitoring, and integrating alerts with incident response processes. OWASP has introduced a separate OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026) to address security risks unique to autonomous, tool-using AI systems. For teams already using the OWASP Top 10 to guide application and supply chain security, this list extends the same risk-based approach to AI-driven automation, copilots, and multi-agent systems increasingly used in production.
