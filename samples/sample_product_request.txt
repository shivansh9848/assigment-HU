Product Request: “Campus Event Companion”

Build a web backend (API-first) for a university campus event companion that helps students discover events, RSVP, and get reminders.

Key outcomes:
- Students can quickly find relevant events (by date, category, location).
- Students can RSVP and view their upcoming schedule.
- Organizers can create and manage events.

Constraints:
- MVP should be simple and reliable; prioritize core flows over fancy features.
- Must be secure (auth, authorization) and handle invalid input gracefully.
- Should support both “student” and “organizer” roles.

Nice-to-have:
- Basic analytics for organizers (views/RSVP count).
- Calendar export (ICS).

Primary user flow:
Signup/Login → Browse events → View event details → RSVP → Receive reminders → Manage RSVP list
